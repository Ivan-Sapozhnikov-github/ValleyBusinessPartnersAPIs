## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run the main application:
```bash
python main.py
```

This launches an interactive menu where you can:

- Use individual tools separately
- Export data in your preferred format

### Programmatic Usage

You can also import and use the tools in your own Python scripts:

#### Google Reviews Tool
```python
from src.tools.google_reviews import GoogleReviewsTool

tool = GoogleReviewsTool()
reviews_df = tool.get_reviews("Big Y World Class Market", "Springfield MA")
tool.export_to_excel(reviews_df, "reviews.xlsx")
```

#### Competitors Tool
```python
from src.tools.competitors import CompetitorsTool

tool = CompetitorsTool()
competitors_df = tool.get_competitors_dataframe(
    business_type="grocery store",
    location="Springfield, MA",
    radius=25000  # 25km radius
)
tool.export_to_excel(competitors_df, "competitors.xlsx")
```

#### OpenAI Research Tool
```python
from src.tools.openai_research import OpenAIResearchTool

tool = OpenAIResearchTool()
analysis = tool.analyze_business(
    business_name="Big Y World Class Market",
    business_type="Grocery Store Chain",
    location="Western Massachusetts",
    additional_context="PE acquisition target"
)
tool.export_to_file(analysis['analysis'], "analysis", format="md")
```

#### SBA Loans Tool
```python
from src.tools.sba_loans import SBALoansTool

tool = SBALoansTool()

# Get current rates
rates_df = tool.get_loan_rates()

# Search loans by state
loans_df = tool.search_loans_by_state("MA", limit=50)

# Get historical rates
historical_df = tool.get_historical_rates(years=5)

# Analyze eligibility
eligibility = tool.analyze_loan_eligibility({
    'annual_revenue': 5_000_000,
    'employees': 25,
    'years_in_business': 5,
    'credit_score': 720
})

# Export all data
tool.export_to_excel({
    'Current Rates': rates_df,
    'Loans in MA': loans_df,
    'Historical Rates': historical_df
}, "sba_data.xlsx")
```

## Output

## Best Practices

1. **API Rate Limits**: Be mindful of API rate limits, especially with Google Places API
2. **Cost Management**: OpenAI API usage incurs costs based on tokens used
3. **Data Privacy**: Don't commit your `.env` file with API keys
4. **Regular Updates**: API endpoints and requirements may change; keep dependencies updated
5. **Batch Processing**: For multiple businesses, consider rate limiting and batch processing

## Troubleshooting

### "API key is required" error
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains valid API keys
- Check that environment variables are loaded (use `python-dotenv`)

### "No reviews found" or "No competitors found"
- Verify the business name and location are correct
- Try broader search terms
- Check that your Google API key has the necessary APIs enabled

### OpenAI API errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Check your usage limits on the OpenAI platform

### Empty or sample SBA data
- The SBA API structure may have changed; tool provides sample data as fallback
- Check `data.sba.gov` for current API documentation
